# JMeter basics

A basic JMeter proof of concept to get a project started.

# Getting started

1. Make a `.env` file based on the `.env.template` file. Update its values if needed.
2. Run `npm run setup` to download and unpack JMeter into the folder structure
3. Make sure you have Java installed

# Usage

`package.json` has scripts with available commands.

After a run, the `reports` folder will have the report, including an HTML version

NOTE: New reports will not overwrite old reports. Keeping the folder from building up excessive old reports is the responsibility of the user.
